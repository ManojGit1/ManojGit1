# Hi, I'm Manoj Kumar Potnuru 👋  
AI Engineer • Data Scientist • Data Engineer

## 🧠 About Me
I’ve been obsessed with numbers since childhood not the equations in textbooks, but the kind that *meant* something.  
As a kid, I used to log cricket scores ball-by-ball and calculate real-time batting averages before the commentators did.  
That curiosity turned into a passion for data systems, machine learning, and large-scale automation. Today, I build GenAI and data platforms that turn complex data into decisions, insights, and impact.

## 🚀 Projects

- **Multi-modal RAG Chatbot for Healthcare Manuals**  
  Built a GenAI-powered assistant that enables conversational search over thousands of PDF manuals which contains text, tables, and images. Helped reduce technician lookup time and improve accuracy in equipment troubleshooting.  
  _LangChain, GPT-4o, ChromaDB, FastAPI, Azure

- **Enterprise-scale Big Data ETL Pipeline**  
  Designed and deployed a PySpark pipeline that ingests and transforms over 10 TB/month of structured/unstructured data. Enabled real-time dashboards and downstream analytics across departments.  
  _PySpark, Airflow, Snowflake, S3

- **Conversational Customer Support Bot**  
  Built an LLM-driven assistant to automate first-level support across chat channels. Resolved 65% of incoming tickets without escalation while maintaining high satisfaction.  
  _OpenAI, LangChain, Streamlit

- **LawChat: Legal LLM for Statutes**  
  Developed a domain-specific chatbot that answers legal questions based on statutes and case summaries.  
  _GPT-4o, LangChain, Neo4j, Streamlit_

- **SpamGuard – Intelligent Spam Filter**  
  Created an NLP pipeline to detect and block spam in real-time across emails and chat logs. Reduced false positives by 18% and blocked over 90% of spam using hybrid ML models.  
  _NLTK, XGBoost, FastAPI_
